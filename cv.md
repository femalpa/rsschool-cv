## About Me
I am responsible, diligent and purposeful. Nevertheless, I consider enthusiasm as my main advantage. Since I wrote my very first and simple 'Hello, World!' script, my main goal has been to get as much knowledge and skills about frontend development as I can, to apply for the position of junior developer and change the field of my professional activity. I hope, The Rolling Scopes School will help me with that.
